important:
Almost all integers are encoded in little endian. Only IP or port number are encoded big endian.






potential places to hide data:

tx_in.sequence

tx.locktime
If all TxIn inputs have final (0xffffffff) sequence numbers then lock_time is irrelevant. Otherwise, the transaction may not be added to a block until after lock_time (see NLockTime).

(the code currently checks for this and has the property LockTime.ContainsHiddenData)
